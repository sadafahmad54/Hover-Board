   <h4> OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
 
<p>Waiver, Release and Assumption of Risk Agreement
To OW Products Limited, whose web address is www.swegway.net, it's proprietors and all associated owners, (Collectively and hereinafter referred to as "OW Products"), from whom I purchase balancing board equipment described on the Invoice of Purchase and their respective stockholders, owners, employees, agents, representatives, dealers, distributors and associates: I assume all risk associated with the use of the board equipment purchased, loaned, given, traded, received, as I understand that using the product, as with all extreme sports, carries an inherent risk of personal injury, property damage or death (Collectively and hereinafter referred to as "Risk"). By purchasing the equipment, I agree to accept all possible known and unknown "Risk" associated with using the equipment. I agree, to the fullest extent of the law, to indemnify and hold harmless and to waive any and all claims that I have or may have in the future against OW Products Ltd resulting from the use of the equipment. I agree to the fullest extent of the law to Release, Indemnify and Hold Harmless OW Products Ltd from any and all liability for injury, loss, damage, death or expense that I, my next of kin or any persons may suffer as a result of my use of the equipment, due to any cause or reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any negligence or breach of contract in the manufacturing, assembling, design, maintenance, selection, sale, adjustment, modification of the board equipment. In the event of my incapacitation or death, this Agreement shall be effective and binding upon my next of kin, relatives, heirs, executors, assigns, administrators, and representatives. In entering this Agreement, I am not relying on any oral or written representation other than what has been set forth above in this Agreement.
I have read and understood this Agreement and I am aware that by purchasing from OW Products Ltd I am agreeing to all aspects of this Agreement and that by doing so, I may be waiving certain rights, including the right to sue Swegway.net, OW Products limited, its associated directors, employees, partners and/or the distributor.</p>
 
<h4>Safety</h4>
<p>Using a Self-balancing board, like all sports, carries an inherent risk of injury, damage to property and death. You should always wear a helmet, pads and any other protective equipment to limit your risk. You should use the product within your abilities, learn to stop  mount and dis-mount. This product is not legal on public Highways, byways, pavements or sidewalks; they may only be used on private property. Don't fall prey to peer pressure and take risks such as not wearing a helmet. Some may say it's not "cool" to wear a helmet or pads, but the risk of permanent injury or death is definitely not "cool".</p>
 
<h4>IMAGES</h4>
<p>The images on this site are for illustrative purposes only. We use a number of different suppliers, each of which has their own unique design, but all have identical specifications. Changes between suppliers, may result in very minor changes, from wheel arch covers, to design differences in the wheels. Your enjoyment of the swegways will not change at all though!</p>
 
<h4>Warranty</h4>
<p>All  boards are warranted to be free of defects in workmanship and materials for 30 days from date of purchase. Due to the nature of the product, damage to the board or its components is not covered. This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, abuse, water damage, delamination due to water exposure, stress cracks, chips, scrapes or any damage from any type impact is not covered.
However, the battery, and the control panels (mainboard and sub-boards) are covered for a period of 3 months, subject to proof that the product has been charged, and used in an appropriate manner, to be decided upon at OW Products Ltd sole discretion.</p>
 
<h4>Conditions of Use</h4>
<p>The equipment user assumes all risks and responsibility outlined in the Waiver, Release and Assumption of Risk Agreement outlined above.</p>
 
<h4>Age limit and your legal rights as a consumer</h4>
<p>If you are a consumer, you may only purchase Products from our site if you are at least 18 years old.
If you are purchasing for a child under the age of 18, you are doing so at your sole discretion. We advise parental/guardian supervision at all times, to ensure that the safety guidelines set-out are adhered to.
As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to Products that are faulty or not as described. Nothing in these Terms will affect these legal rights.</p>
 
 
<h4>DELIVERY</h4>
 
<p>In most instances, the Swegway will be delivered directly to you via our suppliers.
This means we at Swegway.net, will not have had a chance to inspect the product prior to its arrival with you, the customer.
It is therefore vital that upon receipt you are happy with the condition in which has arrived.
It is imperative that you notify us of any defects, issues or problems immediately.</p>
 
<h4>SAFETY AND WELL-BEING</h4>
 
<p>Using our boards is super-fun, but like any extreme sport takes a little time and dedication to become an expert. In our experience, 1 hour of practice will allow you to begin to feel confident.
However, we would highly recommend initially only using the board inside, in a room that has sufficient space, and learn to practice getting on and off safely. This can be done with the help of a friend, or leaning against a wall for support.
Thereafter, learn to make small movements forward, backwards and turn in a circle.
Please be aware, that to begin with, you are likely to fall off at least once or twice…BE SENSIBLE AND TAKE CARE.
Before riding, always check for any faults, cracks or damage to your board. Due to the nature of the internal mechanisms of the product any sharp bang or fall could cause the board to malfunction, and if in any doubt, you should stop using the product and return it for expert examination. 
You are responsible for your own safety, and we highly recommend the use of helmets and pads at all times to limit injuries.  Avoid areas that are too steep, and never board near traffic, on public roads or pavements.</p>
